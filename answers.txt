What is the difference between var and let?
var is function scoped, while let is block scoped.
var can also be re-declared, is hoisted, and can exist as a property on the global (window) scope.
None of which is true for let.

What is the difference between var and const?
Much the same as above, however const cannot be re-assigned, while var can.

What is the difference between let and const?
let can be re-assigned after initialization, while const cannot.
const must also be initialized with a value when declared, while variables declared with let can be initialized later.

What is hoisting?
Hoisting is when a variable's declaration is compiled and ran before its initialization, regardless of its position in the source code.
This behavior only occurs on variables declared with the var keyword.
